This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript related to late binding.  Late binding, while convenient, can lead to runtime errors if object references or method calls are incorrect. The `lateBindingBug.vbs` file contains the buggy code, while `lateBindingSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version emphasizing early binding for improved error handling and maintainability.
